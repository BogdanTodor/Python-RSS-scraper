# Python_RSS_scraper
RSS feed scraper with GUI and integrated event logger
Run the program through IDLE using F5 or run.
Images in repo are used for the design of the GUI.

The purpose of this program is the scrape the desired RSS feed for the entire XML document. REGEX is then applied to the downloaded XML file, whereby all of the necessary information is extracted and stored inside a local html document. Through the GUI, the user can download the most recent days news from CNET, extract the information from the raw XML file and display the information. The user can also use the GUI to access previously archived news to extract and display.

The GUI has a seemlessly integrated event logger with exception handling to inform the user if they have missed a step in extracting, archiving or displaying the web pages, as well as providing the user with text cues to inform them of successes.
